IReNA (Integrated Regulatory Network Analysis) is an R package to perform regulatory network analysis. IReNA contains two methods to reconstruct gene regulatory networks. The first is using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data alone. The second is integrating scRNA-seq data and chromatin accessibility profiles from Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq). IReNA performs modular regulatory network to reveal key transcription factors and significant regulatory relationships among modules, providing biological insights on regulatory mechanisms.

## Installation

Please see the Installation part of [IReNA tutorial](https://jiang-junyao.github.io/IReNA/tutorial#installation)

## Examples and tutorials

If **both ATAC-seq data and scRNA-seq (or bulk RNA-seq data)** are used to reconstruct regulatory network, please run [ATAC-seq raw data preprocessing](https://jiang-junyao.github.io/IReNA/ATAC-seq-preprocessing) first to get bam file, peaks file and footprint file, then run the steps of **part 1**, **part 3** and **part 4** in [IReNA tutorial](https://jiang-junyao.github.io/IReNA/tutorial). If **only scRNA-seq (or bulk RNA-seq data)** are used to reconstruct regulatory network, just directly run the steps of **part 1**, **part 2** and **part 4** in [IReNA tutorial](https://jiang-junyao.github.io/IReNA/tutorial).
